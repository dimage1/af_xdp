Let's send even more packets.

By using *two cores* we should be able to double the number of packets sent, right?

Not quite...

```
sent delta 5960640
sent delta 6087904
sent delta 6095892
sent delta 6096036
sent delta 6108820
sent delta 6091460
sent delta 6092058
sent delta 6097242
sent delta 6093232
sent delta 6095776
```

It's actually _slightly_ slower, what's going on?
