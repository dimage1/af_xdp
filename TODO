DONE

	Sketch out client and server programs

	Update makefile and get it building and linking on linux

	Read AF_XDP resources:

	Find the name of the interface on hulk for the 10G NIC... 

		enp8s0f0

	Get the reflector server running on hulk linux box with the 10G NIC. Disable logging so it's performant.

	Set to only one RSS queue for now:

		sudo ethtool -L enp8s0f0 combined 4
		sudo ethtool -l enp8s0f0

	Setup vision linux box so it's ready to go

	Modify client so it has hard coded interface name

	Get the server IP address and port hardcoded in the client

		192.168.183.124:40000

TODO

	

	--------------

	Implement the AF_XDP client to send and receive packets. Start with just one queue.

	--------------

	Count how many packets per-second are being sent, and how many are being received.

	Print out out once per-second.

	Is it possible to spread packets across multiple RSS queues without having 64 machines?

	Verify I can receive millions of reflected packets...
